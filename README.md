# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and use a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease. It uses a dataset with patient information to train a classification model.

## Dataset

The dataset used is located at `Data/heartdisease.csv`. It contains various attributes related to heart disease prediction, including:

- `age`: Age
- `sex`: Sex (1: male, 0: female)
- `cp`: Chest pain type
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang`: Exercise induced angina
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- `slope`: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- `thal`: Thalassemia
- `target`: Presence of heart disease (1: yes, 0: no)
